## Motivation and Overview: 

**Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for it. Consider that this will be read by people who did not see your project proposal.**

Google's internet game QuickDraw prompts players to draw a given object. 
Such objects include an apple, a kangaroo, or the Eiffel Tower. 
You can play the game here: https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com. 
As the player draws the object, Google attempts to guess what the user is drawing. 
In fact, Google uses user-supplied doodles to train an object recognition algorithm.
Google has released some of the doodle data, and has opened up a Kaggle competition for teams to submit their own algorithms. The goal of competing teams is to produce an algorithm that classifies doodles in a test set.

## Related Work: 

**Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, or something we discussed in class.**



## Initial Questions: 

**What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?**



## Data: 

**What is the data source? Document the data import, wrangling, etc.**

Data was downloaded from the Kaggle website. The website provided two types of data: a raw version and a simplified version that had been pre-processed. We chose to use the pre-processed data so we could focus on the methods. 

We also made the decision to look at just a subset of the drawing types. We wanted to keep the data down to a manageable size. We chose to look at all of the foods, a total of 30 image classes. The drawing types for the foods are listed below:

##### Figure 1: A Doodle from each Food Class

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
knitr::include_graphics("../Sketch_30_Foods.png")
```

For each drawing class, we only used 6,000 images from the simplified data set. We allocated 5,000 images from each class to train our model and 1,000 images to test our model.
